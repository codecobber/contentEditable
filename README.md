# contentEditable
Testing for content editable
The aim is to develop a simple page editor that saves data to flat files using ajax and php.

The idea is to have one button that turns on the contenteditable class and sets the attribute to true, then you simply click the element of choice, edit the text and then turn off editablecontent by removing the class.
